    "When qubits are transmitted over quantum channels, they are subject to a complex set of errors which can cause them to decohere, depolarize, or simply vanish completely. For quantum information transfer to be feasible, the information must be encoded in a error-resistant format using any of a variety of quantum error correction models. In this demonstration, we show how to use $\\texttt{SQUANCH}$’s channel and error modules to simulate quantum errors in a transmitted message, which we correct for using the [Shor Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction#The_Shor_code). This error correction model encodes a single logical qubit into the product of 9 physical qubits and is capable of correcting for arbitrary single-qubit errors. A circuit diagram for this protocol is shown below, where $E$ represents a quantum channel which can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../docs/source/img/shor-code-circuit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we have two pairs of agents: Alice and Bob will communicate a message which is error-protected using the Shor code, and DumbAlice an DumbBob will transmit the message without error correction. Formally, for each state $\\ket{\\psi}$ to be transmitted through the channel, the following procedure is simulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice has some state $\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha_0\\ket{0}+\\alpha_1\\ket{1}$, which she wants to send to Bob through a noisy quantum channel. She encodes her single-qubit state in nine logical qubit as $\\ket{\\psi} \\mapsto \\alpha_0\\bigotimes_{j=1}^3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{000}+\\ket{111}\\right) + \\alpha_1\\bigotimes_{k=1}^3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{000}-\\ket{111}\\right)$ using the circuit diagram above.\n",
    "2. DumbAlice wants to send the same state, but she doesn't error-protect the state and transmits the unencoded state $\\ket{\\psi}\\otimes{\\ket{00\\cdots0}}$.\n",
    "3. Alice and DumbAlice send their qubits through the quantum channel $E$ to Bob and DumbBob, respectively. The channel may apply an arbitrary unitary operation to a single physical qubit in each group of nine.\n",
    "4. Bob receives Alice's qubits and decodes them using the Shor decoding circuit shown above. \n",
    "5. DumbBob expects $\\ket{\\psi}\\otimes{\\ket{00\\cdots0}}$ from DumbAlice and only measures the results of the the first qubit in each group of nine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transmitting an image is unsuitable for this scenario due to the larger size of the Hilbert space involved compared to the previous two demonstrations. (Each $\\texttt{QSystem.state}$ for $N=9$ uses 2097264 bytes, compared to 240 bytes for $N=2$.) Instead, Alice and DumbAlice will transmit the bitwise representation of a short message encoded as $\\sigma_z$-eigenstates, and Bob and DumbBob will attempt to re-assemble the message. "
